# Web-Design-Challenge
#This visualization dashboard website displays plotting images of weather data. In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to 
#navigate between them.

# The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

#* A landing page containing an explanation of the project and links to each visualization page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image 
  will take the user to that visualization. 
#* Four visualization pages, each with a descriptive title and heading tag, the plot/visualization itself, and a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
#* A comparisons page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page so the user can easily visually compare them.
#* A data page that displays a table containing the data used in the visualizations. The bootstrap table was created by converting the cvs file to HTML using Pandas "to_html" method.

#All pages have a navigation menu with a Home button that allows users to return to the landing page from any page, a dropdown menu of Plots that provides a link to each 
#individual visualization page, as well as a button with link to Comparisons, and a Data button with link to the data used.
